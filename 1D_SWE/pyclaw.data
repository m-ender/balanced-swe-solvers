Only the first 7 lines of this file are read.
The first line specifies the solver to be used and
can be one of the following strings:

    UNBALANCED      Implements the source terms via a
                    a simple source splitting, and
                    solves them using Runge-Kutta.
    LEVEQUE         Uses the balanced solver from
                    LeVeque (1998), introducing new
                    discontinuities at the cell centres.
    ROGERS          Uses the balanced solver from
                    Rogers (2013), using deviations from
                    still water as variables.
    ROGERS_GEO      Uses the balanced solver from
                    Rogers (2013), using deviations from
                    geostrophic equilibrium as variables.

The second line specifies the test model to be set up
and can be one of the following strings:

    STILL_LAKE      Flat surface, no momentum.
    WAVE            A wave in a single characteristic.
    ROSSBY          A Rossby adjustment problem.
    GEOSTROPHIC     A Gaussian hump of water in
                    geostrophic equilibrium.
    GEO_WAVE        Superposition of the GEOSTROPHIC and
                    WAVE models.
    STEADY_FLOW     Uniform flow at a specified velocity.
                    A transversal pressure gradient will
                    be imposed to prevent tilting of the
                    surface along y.

The third line specifies the bathymetry and can be one
of the following strings:

    FLAT            Flat bottom, B = 0
    SLOPE           Linear slope increasing with x
    GAUSSIAN        B = 0.5*exp(-128*x^2)
    COSINE          B = 0.5*cos(pi*x*4) for |x| < 0.125
                        0               otherwise
    PARABOLIC_HUMP  B = 0.5 - 32*x^2    for |x| < 0.125
                        0               otherwise
    PARABOLIC_BOWL  B = 2*x^2
    CLIFF           B = (tanh(100x)+1)/4

The fourth value is the number cells to use along x.
The fifth value is the first time T to be plotted.
The sixth value is the maximum time T of the simulation.
The seventh is the number of plots to produce.
The eigth value is the Kelvin number K for the simulation.
The ninth value is the initial x-velocity of the domain.
    This value is only used for the STEADY_FLOW model.
